# QA Execution

**Read when:** a feature reaches its closing QA session.

`qa-plan` and `qa-execute` own the procedures. This guideline only decides whether QA runs, dispatches
the existing Verifier, and points to the authorities that keep the contract stable.

## Trigger

QA runs once per feature, at feature close over the integrated tree; no slice runs QA. Run it when
the feature diff changes an observable UI, API, CLI, mobile surface, public configuration,
adoption flow, docs-as-interface, or user-facing copy, unless the proportional classifier in
`GATES.md` selects a narrower route. A behavior-preserving `direct correction` or `UI-only correction`
is the exception: its targeted integration validation covers the consuming project and it receives no QA Plan/Execute cycle,
even when the rendered component changes. A browser-only invariant explicitly
changed by that correction may use one existing targeted scenario. Purely internal refactors receive
technical verification only. Record `no user-visible change` when no public promise changed.

## Dispatch

After the final implementation deep-review group, use the provider's existing `verifier` with one
phase per packet:

1. Send a fresh `phase: qa-plan` packet to invoke `qa-plan`, create or refresh durable journeys and
   scenarios, and create a new dated charter for this cycle. Never edit an existing charter.
2. Send a distinct fresh `phase: qa-execute` packet to invoke `qa-execute` and walk those journeys.

The QA Plan session ends before the product starts. The QA Execute session does not write product
code. A defect returns to an Implementer; after the fix, a fresh Verifier reruns the technical gate,
retests the affected journey, and resumes the cycle.

## Authorities and adapters

- `docs/guidelines/QA-SCENARIOS.md` owns scenario fields, ids, statuses, and flag/reset rules.
- `docs/qa/README.md` owns the consuming project's public interfaces, existing adapter, setup,
  authentication, fixtures, cleanup, and limitations.
- `qa-execute` selects the declared browser, API, CLI, mobile, or manual adapter. It records the
  exact path, evidence, and limitation. It does not install tooling or invent commands.
- Each checkout owns its runtime and raw evidence. Keep durable reports and statuses in `docs/qa/`
  and keep generated evidence in the consuming project's disposable evidence path.
- When a selected QA scope carries a visual AC, follow `UI-UX.md#verifying-the-built-screen`, point the
  report at its feature `uiux.md` row, and record the paired-capture output fields. A manual comparison
  is evidence, not an automated test; keep behavioral assertions intact.

Read the two skills and `QA-SCENARIOS.md` for the active branch; this bridge deliberately carries no
duplicate scenario schema or live-walk protocol.
