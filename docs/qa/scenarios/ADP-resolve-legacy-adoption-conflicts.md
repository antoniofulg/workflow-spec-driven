title: Resolve reviewed legacy adoption conflicts safely
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: A clean legacy Git project replaces exactly its reviewed workflow file conflicts, preserves project instructions, reaches clean managed status, and rejects incomplete or unsafe ownership transfers without writes.

Covers the public `resolve` ownership transition for projects copied from an older workflow release
before adoption manifests existed. The maintainer must review and repeat every current file conflict,
usually preserve `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` with `--skip-agents`, and confirm clean status after the
one-time resolution.

The same disposable target must prove that omitted, extra, duplicate, absolute, escaping,
managed-block, dirty-target, non-Git, missing-`HEAD`, manifest-backed, and symlink-redirection cases
refuse before writes. Exact injected-failure rollback and direct-argv implementation mechanics stay
with technical verification; QA observes their public atomicity and no-unexpected-effect boundary.

QA Execute on 2026-08-31 passed at `827d629`. A clean committed legacy target reviewed two exact
conflicts, rejected incomplete and unsafe ownership transfers without writes, resolved both through
the public CLI, preserved consumer instruction bytes, reached clean managed status, and remained
byte-stable under normal re-apply. Git-boundary, symlink, and literal-metacharacter probes left no
external or helper effect; every disposable target was removed.
