title: Plan parallel slices without weakening delivery
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-configure-feature-workflow
expected: The read-only planner reports deterministic ready, blocked, checkpoint, or serial-fallback work while the installed orchestration contract keeps slice tasks sequential and preserves every delivery gate.

Retired — the parallel planner and its dispatch statuses were removed by the sequential Lean route.

Covers `PAR-05` through `PAR-16`: one candidate per slice, mode-specific readiness, dependency
waiting and follow-up, deterministic JSON, decisive serial fallback, checkpoint synchronization,
evidence invalidation, and preservation of TLC, Verifier, deep-review, QA, and final-gate stages.

The repository exposes no portable worker runtime. QA therefore walks the public CLI output and the
installed agent-facing policy; provider-specific worktree creation and live model behavior remain
outside this feature's public executable surface.

The hybrid planner contract changes the public mode and writer-lane decisions, so this scenario is
reset to `untested` until fresh QA rewalks the v3 surface.

The planner walk passed on 2026-08-24, including deterministic ready/blocked/follow-up/checkpoint
output and preservation of sequential delivery gates. R19's public resource plan adds the current
two-ready-lane projection and confirms missing-provider serialization is decided by execution
preflight, not by planner mutation. The real worker lifecycle remains separately
`blocked-verify`.
