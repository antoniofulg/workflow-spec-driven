title: List exactly seven workflow entries in the /w menu
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: The /w menu and the pack guide each show exactly the same seven workflow entries, every entry's one-line hint starts with the phase name and states its argument, and roadmap slice 2 is marked done.

Retired — the seven `/w` menu is no longer a Workflow Toolkit public surface.

New promise from `w-entry-points`. The human types `/w` and must see exactly
`wspecify`, `wdesign`, `wtasks`, `wimplement`, `wverify`, `wreview`, and `wqa`.
Each `description` starts with the phase name and contains `Argument:`.
`docs/workflow/pack.md` lists those seven rows; roadmap slice 2 ends `(done)`.

`QAS-resolve-phase-skill-procedures` still owns procedure pointers on the five
phase skills. This scenario owns only the seven-name menu and the docs that
must match it.
