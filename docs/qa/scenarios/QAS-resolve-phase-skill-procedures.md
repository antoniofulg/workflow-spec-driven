title: Resolve each phase procedure through its own skill
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: Each of the five phase skills is invocable, carries the procedure for its phase including Specify Impact, uiux.md, and gap-hunt plus Design designer-dispatch and Verify Impact rerun, and every template, reference, and validator path it names exists, while the router names the phase skills and links no retired reference file.

Retired — the five old phase procedures and router paths were removed. Current Lean and modular
entries have separate 2026-09-13 scenarios.

New promise from the `phase-skills` feature. The five phase procedures moved out of
`workflow-spec-driven/references/{specify,design,tasks,implement,validate}.md` into
`.agents/skills/w<phase>/SKILL.md`, with their artifact templates under each skill's `references/`.
`discuss.md` now lives at `wspecify/references/discuss.md`; `lessons.md`, `memory.md`,
`sub-agents.md`, `code-analysis.md`, and `coding-principles.md` stay with the router.

What breaks silently here is a pointer. An agent that preloads `wimplement` and follows a path that
no longer exists loses the rule at the moment it needs it, and nothing in the gate notices. The walk
therefore follows the paths as written: every relative template reference, every
`.agents/skills/workflow-spec-driven/scripts/<name>.py` citation, and every phase named by the
router.

Frontmatter is part of the promise: each skill's `name` equals its directory, no
`disable-model-invocation` key is present (it would block preload), and the `description` names the
agent that preloads it and its `/w<phase>` entry.

The `w-entry-points` feature rewrites those five frontmatters (fork keys, `Argument:` in
`description`, slash-scoped empty-arg line). Procedure and pointer resolution must be reconfirmed
against the new files, so this row is reset to `untested`. Fork keys and the seven-name menu are
owned by `QAS-fork-w-skills` and `QAS-list-seven-w-entries`. Prior evidence remains historical.

The `specify-impact-designer` feature adds Impact, uiux.md, and gap-hunt steps to Specify, designer
dispatch to Design, Impact rerun to Verify, and `references/gap-hunt.md`. Path resolution must
follow those new pointers. Content of those steps is owned by `QAS-write-specify-impact-and-uiux`
and `QAS-offer-gap-hunt-at-plan-approval`. Reset to `untested`. Prior evidence remains historical.
