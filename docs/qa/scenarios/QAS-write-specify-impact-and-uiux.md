title: Write Specify Impact and uiux.md before design
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: The installed Specify procedure writes an Impact section after the dimensions sweep and, when a screen is added or changed, a uiux.md before the closure gate; Design loads that uiux.md and dispatches designer; Verify reruns the named scenario ids or reports no reruns when Impact is none; the spec template carries Impact between Assumptions and User Stories.

Retired — the prior Specify/Design/Verify phase contract was removed. Current on-demand UI guidance
is covered by Workflow Toolkit routing, not this old artifact sequence.

New promise from `specify-impact-designer`. Specify now maps blast radius and screens before
stories freeze. What breaks silently is a spec that ships with no Impact list and a uiux.md
written after design.

`QAS-resolve-phase-skill-procedures` still owns path resolution on the five phase skills.
This scenario owns the Impact, uiux.md, designer-dispatch, and Impact-rerun steps.
