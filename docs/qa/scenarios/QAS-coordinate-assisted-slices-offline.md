persona: Workflow operator
journey: J-execute-parallel-slices
expected: Default assisted execution uses only ready compatible writer lanes, sends packet pointers without packet bodies, issues each fake-provider mutation once, falls back serially when proof is missing, and cleans owned state to zero residue.

This is the canonical offline assisted-execution promise. It uses only the public CLI/manual adapter
and checkout-local fake Orca, Git, and resource providers. It does not claim that the live Orca host
can complete a worker lifecycle.

The cycle must independently reload persisted packet, ledger, receipt, and residue evidence. Pointer
transport may contain the repository-relative packet pointer but never packet content. Every logical
mutation must have exactly one physical fake-provider call, including transient-response paths.
