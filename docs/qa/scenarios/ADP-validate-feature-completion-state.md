Retired — the prior `validate_state.py` and legacy Result compatibility contract were removed;
native Lean `verification.md` validation owns current completion.

Covers the public completion-gate behavior reported in issue #27. An explicit `Verdict: FAIL`
must remain a failure even when a legacy `Result: PASS` appears later, and an explicit `Verdict:
PASS` must remain a pass even when a legacy `Result: FAIL` appears later. Reports without an explicit
verdict retain the supported legacy `Result: PASS` form.

QA on 2026-08-22 confirmed all three forms through a freshly adopted validator. Five edge probes
also confirmed punctuation and case handling, prose isolation, explicit-placeholder fail-closed
behavior, legacy summary support, and malformed-explicit-verdict fail-closed behavior.
