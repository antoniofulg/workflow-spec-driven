expected: The README, pack guide, and QA skills distinguish bundled local adaptations from their linked sources and from three separately authorized, pinned external security skills without naming a consuming product or stack.

Covers public provenance, authorship, clean-room adaptation language, the bundled-versus-external
security-skill boundary in `SSK-07`, and the reusable package's stack-agnostic scope. The current
pass re-read the credits, both QA skill provenance statements, the three immutable external-skill
entries, and the product-neutral introduction as the QA-contract journey's adjacent canary.

The `phase-skills` feature changes the bundled-capability list a reader evaluates: `docs/workflow/pack.md` now declares eleven local capabilities including the five phase skills, `README.md` names the router plus its phase skills, and `docs/workflow/roadmap.md` is new. Reconfirmed on 2026-09-03: the eleven-capability claim matches its table and the installed tree, both QA skills keep their provenance statements, and the three external security skills stay pinned dependencies. Prior evidence remains historical.
