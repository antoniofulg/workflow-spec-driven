title: Synchronize every provider agent from central model settings
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-configure-feature-workflow
expected: An explicit sync initializes local state when needed, renders all eighteen native model and effort fields from templates plus `.my-workflow.toml` including the designer tables, refuses a missing designer table by name with no writes, reports idempotent results, and adoption preserves local configuration.

Covers E2E-001 and E2E-002: local model/effort editing, template-driven native packet generation,
idempotent reporting, invalid-source and symlink containment, frozen delegated settings, explicit
drift rejection, fresh adoption, and runtime regeneration.

The `phase-skills` feature makes Claude templates carry `skills:` and `disallowedTools:` and gives `--sync-agents` a new fail-closed preflight, so the rendering promise now covers lines this scenario never walked; walked on 2026-09-03 and confirmed `pass`: a perturbed `.my-workflow.toml` changed only the `model` and `effort` lines of the affected packets, while `skills:` and `disallowedTools:` were carried through byte for byte. Prior evidence remains historical.

The `specify-impact-designer` feature adds `designer` as a sixth matrix role (eighteen native model and effort fields), three `[models.<provider>.designer]` example tables, three designer templates, and a fail-closed missing-table refusal. `AGENTS.md` names designer among the roles and stays at or below 134 lines; `docs/workflow/pack.md` names five windows. Reset to `untested`. Prior evidence remains historical.

The `lean-consumer-installation` cycle moves the provider template source under
`workflow-config/assets/agents`. Reset to `untested`; prior evidence remains historical. Walk
`CH-sync-skill-owned-agent-packets-2026-09-08` against the final reviewed installed package.
