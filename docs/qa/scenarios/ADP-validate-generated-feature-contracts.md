title: Validate TLC-generated feature contracts
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: The vendored validators accept both TLC-generated task layouts and its annotated acceptance-criteria heading while still rejecting future-phase dependencies and criteria without SHALL.

Retired — the prior spec/tasks validators and compatibility layouts were removed; current native
Lean validator coverage lives in `QAS-use-lean-feature-lifecycle`.

Covers the public developer CLI behaviour reported in issue #39. Valid feature files produced from
the TLC templates must pass without hand edits; the same validators must retain their discriminating
failures for a dependency on a future phase and an acceptance criterion without `SHALL`.

QA on 2026-08-22 ran both adopted validator CLIs from a disposable target. Both generated task
layouts and the annotated acceptance-criteria template passed; future-phase dependency and missing
`SHALL` probes failed with precise diagnostics before and after re-adoption.
