title: Install the review and QA entry skills with the core layer
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: A core-layer adoption reports the review and QA entry skills as managed and leaves each SKILL.md plus a .claude/skills link that opens the same file.

New promise from `w-entry-points`. `scripts/adopt.py` `CORE_PATHS` gained
`.agents/skills/wreview` and `.agents/skills/wqa`. The checkout tracks
`.claude/skills/wreview` and `.claude/skills/wqa` as symlinks to
`../../.agents/skills/<name>`. A core `plan --json` lists those four paths;
after `apply`, both read paths open one file.

Each installed entry stays under 40 lines. The `wreview` body names
`.agents/skills/deep-review/SKILL.md` and refuses `--publish`. The `wqa` body
runs exactly one QA phase (`qa-plan` when the first argument is `plan`, else
`qa-execute`) and stops when no journey carries the flow tag.

`ADP-install-phase-skills` still owns the original five phase-skill
directories. This scenario owns only the two entry skills and their wrap
instructions.
