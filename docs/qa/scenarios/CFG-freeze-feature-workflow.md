title: Freeze and safely resume a feature workflow
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-configure-feature-workflow
expected: Resolution and resume report the live remediation stall bound without persisting it, while model/effort routes, cadence, selected parallelization mode, and safe optional resource provider remain frozen until an explicit refresh; packet drift still requires explicit synchronization and refresh.

Covers `CWF-STATE-1` through `CWF-STATE-4`, `PAR-01` through `PAR-04`, and the public configuration
portion of EXE-19–EXE-21: complete snapshot fields, repeat stability, preservation of a prior valid
snapshot on atomic-write failure, and frozen resume until a human requests refresh. The 2026-08-24
resolver walk passed snapshot, mode, invalid-input, repeat, and frozen-resume checks. R19 confirmed
safe mode preserves a frozen `resource_provider: null` boundary before execution; resource-bearing
lanes serialize through the linked fallback scenario. No configured consumer provider or
resource-isolation claim is made.
`SRH-02` adds a deliberate live-state exception: `remediation.stall_attempts` appears in current CLI
JSON, never in `workflow.json`, and may change on resume without changing frozen route, cadence, or
snapshot bytes.

The hybrid-slice feature changes the public configuration to schema v3 with `assisted` and
`disabled` modes and `max_workers`; this scenario is reset to `untested` pending fresh QA of the
new surface.

The 2026-08-24 evidence remains historical. The live-output and snapshot-boundary change at
`cada159` was re-walked through the CLI/manual path on 2026-08-25. Resolution reported `4`, resume
reported live `6`, and independent JSON/hash reads confirmed byte-identical frozen route, model,
effort, cadence, and snapshot with no persisted remediation key. The earlier final report remains
in `docs/qa/reports/2026-08-25-parallel-slice-executor-final.md`; the latest report is recorded above.
