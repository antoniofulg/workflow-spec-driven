title: Discover independent QA skills through the existing Verifier
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: The adopted tree exposes qa-plan and qa-execute, and every provider routes each phase through its existing Verifier contract.

Retired — this row names the non-namespaced QA skill paths. Current `wtk-qa-plan` and
`wtk-qa-execute` routing is covered by `QAS-route-workflow-toolkit-intent`.

Covers skill discovery, planning/execution separation, scenario-authority routing, adapter reporting,
and the Implementer → fresh Verifier defect handoff. QA retest on 2026-08-25 after fix `1593299`
passed: all six provider templates and generated runtime packets carried the fresh-packet contract
and independent evidence sources after reload.

The `phase-skills` feature rewrites the provider Verifier packets this scenario inspects: the Claude template gains `skills: [wverify]`, and the Cursor and Codex bodies name phase skills in place of retired reference files. The qa-plan/qa-execute routing promise must be reconfirmed against the new packets, so it was reconfirmed on 2026-09-03: all three provider Verifier packets route the three phases, and both QA skills resolve through `.agents/skills/` and their `.claude/skills/` links after the `quality` layer that ships them. Prior evidence remains historical.
