title: Reuse a passing gate result for an unchanged tree

journey: J-run-project-gates
expected: A gate that already passed on this exact tree finishes without running the command again and names the gate, fingerprint and log path that back the claim.

New promise from the gate result cache. This scenario owns the reuse half: `GRC-01` (a miss executes
and records), `GRC-02` (a matching passing record short-circuits), and `GRC-03` (the key is tree
content plus gate label plus exact command).

Reuse is only true if invalidation is true, so the same walk must show that a tracked edit, a staged
change, an untracked file, a different gate label, and a different command each force execution,
while a commit that changes no worktree content does not.

`AD-021` makes a matching passing record admissible readiness evidence at every gate scope, so the
walk must confirm scope binding directly: a record written under `scoped` must not satisfy a claim
that the full gate passed. The observable is a different fingerprint, not a different verdict.

The refusal half — a failing gate, a damaged record, an absent log, an uncomputable tree — is
`QAS-run-the-gate-when-the-cache-cannot-vouch`. Split because they are two different promises to the
operator: this one says the cache saves a run, that one says the cache can never cost one.

A fresh Verifier walked the reuse tour on 2026-09-01 at `aa2fbc6` in a checkout-local disposable
repository with a counting stand-in gate, reading every verdict from the counter, the record and the
log. Fifteen invocations produced six executions. A miss executed and recorded `status: "pass"`; two
identical reruns hit without advancing the counter. A tracked edit, a staged-but-uncommitted change
and a new untracked unignored file each produced a distinct fingerprint and executed; reverting each
restored the original hit. An ignored file and an `--allow-empty` commit left fingerprint and counter
alone. A second `--gate` label and an altered command each wrote their own record. Scope binding
holds: the `scoped` record for tree `b13b384f…` did not satisfy `--gate full`, which fingerprinted
differently and executed. Against the real gate, `--gate full -- bun run test:all` on the unchanged
source checkout returned a hit on fingerprint `da698c7e…` in 0.61 s, confirmed by reading the record
and the tail of the log it cites, and again on a re-read.

Documentation wiring is narrower than an earlier draft of this file claimed. This delivery's spec
carries `GRC-01`–`GRC-05` only and records "Wiring depth: Tool only in this delivery"; its single
documentation criterion is that `GATES.md` names the invocation, which it does at line 58. The
`autonomous` readiness row, the `implement.md` reference and `qa-execute` do not name the cached
invocation and are not required to in this delivery.
