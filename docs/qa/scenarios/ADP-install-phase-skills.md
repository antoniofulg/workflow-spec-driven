title: Install the five phase skills with the core layer
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: A core-layer adoption reports the five phase skill directories as managed and leaves the target holding each `.agents/skills/w<phase>/SKILL.md` plus a `.claude/skills/w<phase>` link that resolves to it, while re-adoption preserves consumer-owned skill trees.
entry_points: README.md#adopt-the-workflow; npx workflow-spec-driven install; .agents/skills/wspecify; .agents/skills/wdesign; .agents/skills/wtasks; .agents/skills/wimplement; .agents/skills/wverify; .claude/skills/

New promise from the `phase-skills` feature. `scripts/adopt.py` `CORE_PATHS` gained
`.agents/skills/wspecify`, `wdesign`, `wtasks`, `wimplement`, and `wverify`, and `_prepare_sync`
now treats `.agents/skills` as a sync input alongside skill-owned packet assets. The checkout tracks
`.claude/skills/w<phase>` as symlinks to `../../.agents/skills/w<phase>`.

The observable an adopter cares about is the installed result, not the catalog constant: after a
core apply the target must be able to open each phase procedure through both the canonical path and
the Claude link, and a second apply over a target carrying consumer-owned skills must not clobber
them.

`ADP-adopt-workflow-safely` and `ADP-layered-workflow-adoption` remain the canonical owners of the
general adoption safety and layering promises; this scenario owns only the phase-skill membership
and link resolution.

The `w-entry-points` feature changes the files a core apply leaves under those five directories
(fork keys and slash-scoped bodies) and adds two sibling entry skills to the same catalog.
Reconfirm the five-skill install against the new tree; `ADP-install-review-and-qa-entries` owns
`wreview` and `wqa`. Reset to `untested`. Prior evidence remains historical.
