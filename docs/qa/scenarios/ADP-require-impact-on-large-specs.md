title: Require Impact on Large and Complex specs
persona: Workflow adopter
journey: J-adopt-workflow
expected: The adopted validate_spec CLI exits non-zero naming ## Impact for a Large or Complex spec that lacks that section, and does not require the section for Medium, Small, or a Large spec whose Impact is none.

Retired — the size-class `validate_spec.py` contract was removed; native Lean plan validation now
owns current artifact checks.

New promise from `specify-impact-designer`. Size on the spec header line gates the Impact
section. Copy the five size fixtures into a disposable target and run the adopted
`validate_spec.py` against those copies.

`ADP-validate-generated-feature-contracts` still owns TLC layouts and SHALL. This scenario
owns only the size-aware Impact rule.
