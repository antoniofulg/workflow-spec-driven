# Execute: Validate & Verify

Slash argument: $ARGUMENTS — when this skill was entered with /wverify and the argument is empty, stop and ask for the feature or slice; when preloaded into an agent, the packet names the slice and this line is informational.

**Goal**: Verify implementation meets spec AND coding principles. This is NOT a separate phase - verification is part of every task's completion within Execute.

**Three levels of verification:**

1. **Per-task verification (always, author self-check):** After implementing each task, verify its "Done when" criteria before committing. This is mandatory and automatic. The implementer runs it.

2. **Slice-level validation (fresh Technical Verifier, always-on, never prompted):** After each code-changing slice reaches its checkpoint, the coordinator dispatches a **fresh Technical Verifier** (see [sub-agents.md](.agents/skills/workflow-spec-driven/references/sub-agents.md)) before any dependent slice consumes that checkpoint. Independent slices may be verified concurrently; each dependent route waits only for its own verified checkpoint. It runs without asking the user. The Verifier:
   - Runs **read-only** over the real implementation and tests - mutations run in a scratch/throwaway state only (see Discrimination Sensor section)
   - Scopes coverage to the feature's **git diff surface** (not the full repository)
   - Re-derives coverage independently using **evidence-or-zero**: every behavioral AC must be traced to a `file:line` + assertion expression; a visual AC uses the paired capture verdict for its feature `uiux.md` row and source revision
   - Runs the **spec-anchored outcome check** and the **discrimination sensor** (both described below)
   - Writes `.specs/features/[feature]/validation-[slice].md` with the full slice evidence report as versioned workflow state; a concurrent Verifier therefore cannot overwrite another slice's evidence. The final integrated Verifier alone writes `.specs/features/[feature]/validation.md`.
   - Returns a compact verdict + ranked gap list to the orchestrator in chat
   - Gaps become **fix tasks** routed back to an implementer; re-verification uses the immutable finding fingerprint and third-failure halt in `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md`

3. **Final integrated validation (fresh Verifier, when selected):** Once the feature's verified slices are integrated, run final feature-level checks over the integrated tree only when the proportional classifier in `docs/guidelines/GATES.md` selects them. This is separate from per-slice Technical Verifiers and from the final integrated Deep Review and QA when those stages are selected; neither stage replaces the other. Scoped documentation and instruction changes record their narrower evidence and limitation. User interaction is limited to interactive UAT (for user-facing features) and acting on a FAIL verdict ("fix these gaps now?").

4. **Interactive UAT (for user-facing features only):** The feature has complex user-facing behavior where human judgment matters (UI flows, interaction patterns, visual design). For backend-only or infrastructure work, automated checks are sufficient.

**Trigger for explicit validation:** "Validate", "verify work", "UAT", "test with me", "walk me through it"

## Visual reference evidence

For a visual AC, read `docs/guidelines/UI-UX.md#verifying-the-built-screen` and the feature `uiux.md`
row in `design_excerpt` (or bounded inline record); use the report's visual-evidence fields. Missing
evidence is unverified and cannot PASS; mismatch fails. Behavioral assertions remain required; no
universal pixel threshold or DOM identity rule applies.

## Process

### 1. Check Completed Work

Confirm all tasks (or inline execution plan steps) are marked done with their gate results.

### 2. Spec-Anchored Acceptance Criteria Check

For each acceptance criterion in `spec.md`, the Verifier re-derives the **spec-defined expected outcome** and confirms the test's actual assertion matches it:

```markdown
### P1: [Story Title]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

| Criterion (WHEN X THEN Y) | Spec-defined outcome | Behavioral `file:line` assertion, or visual `uiux.md` row + capture verdict | Result |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| WHEN [X] THEN [Y]         | [precise value/state from spec] | `path/to/test.ts:42` - `expect(result.field).toBe(expected)` or `uiux.md#reference` + report row | ✅ PASS / ❌ GAP / ⚠️ Spec-precision gap |
```

**Rules:**

- Where the spec defines a precise outcome (specific status code, field value, error message, state), the test assertion targets that exact outcome - not just that an assertion exists.
- Where the spec does not define a precise outcome, mark as **⚠️ Spec-precision gap** and flag it in the report; a vague assertion is never passed silently.
- Behavioral evidence-or-zero: a criterion with no `file:line` citation counts as NOT covered. A visual criterion uses the paired capture verdict in the existing report, with its feature `uiux.md` row and source revision; a manual comparison is not an automated assertion.

### 3. Check Edge Cases

From spec.md edge cases: verify each listed edge case is handled correctly.

### 3.5. Rerun Impacted QA Scenarios

Rerun the QA scenario ids named in `spec.md` `## Impact` and report each as pass, fail, or untested. If `## Impact` is `none`, report no reruns.

### 4. Run Build-Level Gate Check

Run the Build-level gate check from the **Gate Check Commands** section in `tasks.md` when present.
When Tasks was skipped, run the gate command recorded in the inline execution plan.

1. Run: `[Build gate command from tasks.md, or the inline execution plan's verify command]`
2. Non-zero exit code: stop; the Code Quality Check waits for a green gate.
3. Record results:
   - Total test count: [N]
   - Passed: [N]
   - Failed: [list]
   - Skipped: [list - each skip must be justified]

**Test Integrity Check:**

- Compare current test count against the count before this feature was implemented
- If test count DECREASED: investigate why. Tests should only be deleted with explicit justification.
- If assertions were weakened (less specific than before): flag as potential regression

### 5. Discrimination Sensor (runs after the gate check passes)

The sensor provides the empirical guarantee that the tests can actually detect regressions. It runs in a scratch/throwaway state - the real working tree is never modified.

**How it works:**

1. **Prepare an isolated scratch.** Never mutate the real worktree. Choose one:
   - Preferred: a temporary git worktree (`git worktree add <scratch-path> HEAD`), mutate and run tests there, then `git worktree remove --force <scratch-path>`.
   - Fallback (no git / worktree unavailable): copy only the affected file(s) to a temp directory, mutate the copies, point the test runner at those copies (or restore originals from the copies' backups), then delete the temp directory.
   - **Forbidden:** `git stash` / `git stash pop`. A stash records state *before* the mutation; popping it does not reverse a mutation applied afterward, and on a clean tree `git stash` creates no entry at all - so the fault is left in the real worktree.
2. **Capture a baseline.** Record `git status --porcelain` (or equivalent) of the real worktree *before* any sensor work. It must be unchanged after cleanup.
3. **Inject a behavior-level fault** into the scratch copy of the new code introduced by this feature. Choose a mutation proportional to the code's risk:
   - Flip a boolean condition (`if (x)` → `if (!x)`, `>` → `>=`)
   - Change a return value (return a wrong status code, wrong field, zero instead of a computed value)
   - Off-by-one (shift a loop bound, change a slice index)
   - Remove a required side effect (delete a method call that the spec requires)
4. **Run the tests** that cover the mutated code (against the scratch). Use the Quick or Full gate
   command from `tasks.md` when present, or the inline execution plan's verify command when Tasks
   was skipped.
5. **Confirm the mutant is killed** (tests FAIL). Discard the scratch (remove worktree or delete temp copies).
6. **Verify isolation.** Re-run `git status --porcelain` on the real worktree and confirm it matches the baseline from step 2. If it differs, STOP - restore the real tree before continuing, and treat the sensor run as invalid.
7. **If a mutant survives** (tests still pass after the fault), the tests are not discriminating for that behavior - add a fix task to strengthen the assertion.

**Tiering (proportional, not optional):**

| Context | Sensor depth |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Default (all features) | Lightweight fault-injection: 1-3 targeted behavior-level mutations per feature, focused on the highest-risk new code |
| P0 / critical paths (payment, auth, data integrity) | Full mutation run: use language-appropriate mutation tooling if available (e.g., Stryker, mutmut, cargo-mutants, pitest); otherwise increase the number of manual fault-injection mutations to ≥5 covering all branches |

**Stack-agnostic:** The sensor targets behavior-level semantics (what the code does), not a specific tool. Any language, any framework.

**Report:** Record killed/survived for each mutation attempt. Surviving mutants → create fix tasks before marking the feature done.

### 6. Code Quality Check

For each changed file, verify against [coding-principles.md](.agents/skills/workflow-spec-driven/references/coding-principles.md):

| Check                                | Pass? |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| No features beyond what was asked    |       |
| No abstractions for single-use code  |       |
| No unnecessary "flexibility" added   |       |
| Only touched files required for task |       |
| Didn't "improve" unrelated code      |       |
| Matches existing patterns/style      |       |
| Would senior engineer approve?       |       |
| Tests map to acceptance criteria and are non-shallow (spot-check one story) | |
| Spec-anchored outcome check: each test's asserted value matches the spec-defined outcome (or gap flagged) | |
| Per-layer Coverage Expectation met: domain logic has 1:1 AC mapping; routes/e2e cover happy + edge + error paths for every route in scope | |
| Every test in scope maps to a spec AC, listed edge case, or Done-when criterion (no unclaimed tests) | |
| Documented project quality/testing guidelines followed (cite guideline file, or "none - strong defaults applied") | |

❌ Any "No"? → Fix before marking complete.

### 7. Interactive UAT (if user-facing feature)

For each testable deliverable, present one test at a time:

```
Test [N]: [Test Name]

Expected: [What should happen - specific and observable]

→ Does this work? Describe what you see.
```

Wait for the user's response. A confirmation is a pass, an explicit skip is a skip, and anything else is an issue logged verbatim.

**Severity is inferred, never asked.** Rate each issue Blocker / Major / Minor / Cosmetic from what the user described, using the severity scheme in `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md`; when the description is too thin to tell, default to Major.

### 8. Generate Fix Plans (if issues found)

For each issue found during UAT or from the Verifier:

1. **Diagnose** - Analyze the codebase to find root cause
2. **Create fix task** - Write a task definition with:
   - What: The specific fix
   - Where: File paths
   - Verify: How to prove the fix works
   - Done when: Acceptance criteria for the fix
3. **Present fix plan** - Show all fix tasks to user for approval

Fix tasks follow the same format as regular tasks and can be executed with the implement phase.

**Guardrail:** Maximum 3 diagnostic iterations per issue. If root cause isn't found after 3 attempts, flag for human investigation. This diagnostic cap is per issue and separate from review-remediation fingerprint accounting in `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md`.

### 9. Write Validation Report File + Return Chat Summary

After all checks complete, the Verifier:

1. **Write the final feature report** to `.specs/features/[feature]/validation.md` (see the Validation Report Template section of `references/validation-template.md`) only after all slice reports exist and the verified slices are integrated. It is versioned workflow state and travels with the feature when committed. A slice-level Verifier writes `.specs/features/[feature]/validation-[slice].md` instead.
2. **Return a compact summary in chat** to the orchestrator (see the Compact Chat Summary section of `references/validation-template.md`). The orchestrator surfaces it to the user and routes any ranked gaps to fix tasks.

**Deterministic backing (run it, do not eyeball it).** After writing the report, run `python3 .agents/skills/workflow-spec-driven/scripts/validate_state.py <feature>`. It confirms the report is real - present, verdict filled to PASS, and backed by at least one `file:line` evidence citation - so a missing, hollow, placeholder, or FAIL report cannot slip through as done. A non-zero exit means the feature is NOT done: repair the report or route the FAIL gaps to fix tasks, then re-run. This is the closing gate of Execute and runs automatically, the same way the lessons layer runs at distillation; it is never a manual step. If no code-execution tool is available, confirm the same by reading `validation.md`.

### 10. Distill Lessons (when validation.md has signal)

This is the closing action of validation - not a separate phase. Immediately after the report is written, turn its grounded failures into reusable, project-local guidance by following [lessons.md](.agents/skills/workflow-spec-driven/references/lessons.md). In short: for each surviving mutant, spec-precision gap, failed/uncovered AC, or `// SPEC_DEVIATION`, record one terse general lesson via `python3 .agents/skills/workflow-spec-driven/scripts/lessons.py add` (the script enforces grounding and owns all bookkeeping). A clean PASS with no signal → record nothing. Run the self-check: if there was signal but no lesson was recorded, say so in chat. See [lessons.md](.agents/skills/workflow-spec-driven/references/lessons.md) for the exact commands, phrasing rules, scope discipline, and the no-script fallback.

Write the compact chat summary and `validation[-slice].md` from `references/validation-template.md`.
