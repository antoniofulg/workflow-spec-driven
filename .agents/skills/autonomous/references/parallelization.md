# Parallel Slice Dispatch

This contract adds coordinator-assisted concurrency between slices. The workflow-spec-driven
skill is slice-native: independent slices may run concurrently, while tasks inside one slice
remain sequential in its worker/worktree.

## Entry gate

1. Resolve the feature workflow with `.agents/skills/workflow-config/SKILL.md`.
2. Read the frozen `workflow.json` before planning. Never plan from current configuration while
   resuming a feature.
3. Run the read-only planner from the repository root:

   ```bash
   python3 .agents/skills/workflow-config/scripts/parallel_plan.py \
     --root . --feature <feature-slug> [--verified-slice <slice>]
   ```

4. Assisted dispatch is the default when the frozen mode, plan, and executor capability allow it.
   Independent compatible slices may open together; dependent consumption waits for verification.

5. The `auto`/`orca` executor capability gate is proven only when the `orca` runtime is
   discoverable and the adapter declares `orchestration.contract.v1`; otherwise return serial
   recovery with zero worktree, worker, Git, or provider effects.

6. A lane with `Resources: none` bypasses the consumer provider; any declared resource names
   require the frozen executable and a prepared correlated lease before worker start.

`disabled`, an invalid or fallback plan, a missing frozen snapshot, or no capable isolated executor
uses the existing serial path without creating a worker or worktree. Any uncertainty or failure
serializes safely; a capability that cannot prove worktree, runtime, port, and persistence isolation
is not capable for this contract.

## Executor commands

From the repository root, the public verbs are:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/parallel_execute.py start \
  --root . --feature <feature-slug> --adapter auto
python3 .agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/parallel_execute.py resume \
  --root . --feature <feature-slug> --adapter auto --wait-seconds <1..3600>
python3 .agents/skills/autonomous/scripts/parallel_execute.py status \
  --root . --feature <feature-slug>
```

Each verb emits one JSON object naming `command`; `status` is read-only. `resume` consumes persisted
receipts and at most one correlated delivery, while `start` runs the point-in-time plan. A rejected
capability, invalid plan, missing snapshot, unsupported provider, dirty checkpoint, failed gate,
or cleanup failure returns serial recovery without creating a replacement effect.

## Dispatch boundary

- Use one worker per slice. The orchestrator owns the slice worktree, runtime, and checkpoint.
- Exactly one ready slice is a serial-integration lane: it uses the clean integration checkout and
  creates no extra worktree. Persistent writer worktrees are admitted only when at least two
  compatible ready slices are selected.
- A worker runs its slice's tasks in task order. Tasks inside a slice remain sequential.
- Each task still has its own implementation, scoped gate, `tasks.md` update, and atomic commit.
- The orchestrator never starts a later task in a slice before the planner marks its dependencies
  available.
- A worker does not create another worker and does not edit another slice's worktree.

## Proof boundary

The coordinator records each Implementer's author identity with its slice and
checkpoint. The role-route table below is the single machine-readable source for
the owner, author relation, and tree boundary of every proof stage. Packets and
runtime dispatch follow these rows; this prose only describes the lifecycle.

<!-- role-route:v1 -->
| stage | owner | author relation | tree | cardinality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| implement | implementer | author-only | private-slice | per-slice |
| technical | technical-verifier | fresh-not-author | private-checkpoint | per-slice |
| integrate | coordinator | coordinator | integrated-head | once |
| deep-review | deep-reviewer | fresh-not-author | integrated-head | per-group |
| qa-plan | qa-plan | fresh-not-author | integrated-head | once |
| qa-execute | qa-execute | fresh-not-author | integrated-head | once |
| handoff | last-implementer | author-only-no-proof | private-checkpoint | last-implementer |
<!-- /role-route:v1 -->

Technical Verification is a fresh session with a different identity and reads
the exact private writer worktree at that checkpoint. After verified checkpoints
are integrated, Deep Review receives the integrated commit range on the clean
integration checkout. Fresh QA Plan and QA Execute sessions receive that
integrated final tree. No proof role reuses the author identity or certifies a
private tree as the final result.

Every implementation slice closes its technical review before a dependent slice consumes its
checkpoint. Independent compatible slices may open concurrently.

The plan's `ready` lane is permission to start the named task, not permission to skip a gate. A
`waiting` or `in_progress` task is never a fresh worker; the planner's state transition is part of
the dispatch decision.

## Waiting and follow-up

The event lifecycle is run-scoped and receipt-scoped:

```text
check --run <run> --wait --types worker_done,question,escalation
check --run <run> --ack <delivery-id>
worker-read --dispatch <dispatch-id>
worker-release --dispatch <dispatch-id>
```

The coordinator reads and accepts the correlated worker result before release. A clean waiter is
ended before the dependency event can follow up on the same terminal; a timeout leaves state
unchanged. Missing, duplicate, foreign, escalated, dirty, or failed receipts serialize without a
replacement worker.

When a worker reaches an unavailable dependency, it must first leave a clean committed checkpoint
and report the exact dependency and current head. It must then end the clean worker turn. The
orchestrator records the waiter and resumes the same worker with a follow-up after the dependency completion event. It does not poll, spin, or spend model turns checking unchanged state.

If the worker is dirty, cannot report its checkpoint, or the event cannot be correlated to the
declared dependency, it is not a valid waiter: pause the lane and use the existing serial recovery
path. A follow-up re-plans the point-in-time state; it does not bypass the task gate or create a
second worker for the same task.

## Synchronization

- Synchronize at declared dependency checkpoints before the dependent task consumes a newer
  upstream commit.
- Use the exact upstream commit recorded by the dependency event, then run the affected gate before
  continuing.
- Do not rebase after every task. Checkpoint sync is the normal cadence.
- Reconcile the final upstream base only when it advanced. If the consumed checkpoint already equals
  the final base, final reconciliation is a no-op.
- A conflict, ambiguous integration, failed gate, or missing checkpoint serializes safely or halts
  the lane; it never silently chooses one side.
- A changed checkpoint persists `current_head` and invalidates `gate`, Technical Verifier, and
  deep-review evidence. The lane remains `gate_required` until the affected gate receipt matches
  the lane and current head; only then may waiting follow-up continue.

Verified slices are merged into the feature integration branch in deterministic slice order with
preserved commits. Merge conflicts abort and return serial recovery; no automatic resolution is
attempted.

## Evidence invalidation

If synchronization, integration, or remediation changes a reviewed tree, invalidate every affected gate, Verifier, and deep-review verdict. Repeat the affected gate on the resulting tree before the next task or review stage. Evidence from a prior commit is not evidence for a rebased tree.

The normal evidence contract remains intact:

- one atomic commit and scoped gate per task;
- one technical Verifier per code-changing slice;
- deep-review at the frozen groups (none when the frozen cadence is `skip`; nothing waits for it);
- final QA;
- one full gate on the final tree.

Parallel dispatch may reduce wall time, but it never removes, merges, or postpones these readiness
stages past their required source freeze.

## QA handoff

E2E-001 is an explicit fresh-QA handoff, not an author-run pilot. Its interface, expected receipts,
and cleanup assertions are recorded in `.specs/features/parallel-slice-executor/qa-pilot.md`.
Canonical final QA records E2E-001 as terminal `BLOCKED-VERIFY` at the external Orca/Codex
lifecycle boundary; no completed pilot is claimed.

## Serial fallback

Serial fallback is the default recovery for disabled mode, missing or invalid metadata, conflicting
ready lanes, unavailable isolation, dirty waiting state, checkpoint failure, integration conflict,
or any uncertainty. The fallback follows the existing autonomous serial path and creates no parallel
worker or worktree for the rejected plan.
