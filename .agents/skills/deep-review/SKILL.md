# Deep Review

Review at CodeRabbit grade with no file cap and one assertive posture: funnel the diff, discover root/nested project instructions and relevant local skills, shard the diff into defect cohorts, run reviewers with a bounded concurrency, then merge with complete hunk accounting. Defects require causal evidence and control the verdict; advisories require a concrete improvement and always remain visible.

Steps 1–4 drive an idempotent artifact pipeline under `<out>`: every stage gate is a bundled-script exit 0, valid agent outputs are never re-run, and an interrupted round resumes by re-running the same commands.

`<skill-dir>` below means the directory containing this SKILL.md; run every bundled command from the repo root.

## Inputs (all optional)

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--pr <n>` | Review a GitHub PR (requires authenticated `gh`; head fetched locally) | — |
| `--base <ref>` / `--staged` | Local diff scope | merge-base with the origin default branch |
| `--worktree` | Review uncommitted + untracked work against the base ref (always a full round) | — |
| `--files <p1,p2>` | Restrict review to these paths | full diff |
| `--concurrency <n>` | Override repository reviewer concurrency (`1`–`6`) while building the manifest | `.deep-review.yaml` or `3` |
| `--spec <path>` | Spec file or directory; its contract-bearing artifacts are listed in the context pack's Spec contract section | — |
| `--subagent <runtime>` | Step 3 reviewer runtime: `native` \| `claude-opus` \| `grok` \| `codex` — non-native runs cross-LLM via `compozy exec` | `native` |
| `--max-cohort-files <n>` | Maximum files assigned to one cohort; the ~6,000 changed-line cap still applies | `100` |
| `--publish` | Post walkthrough + review to the PR | off — local report only |
| `--full` | Ignore prior state; review the whole diff again | incremental when state exists |
| `--out <dir>` | Artifact directory | `.deep-review/<target>/` |
| `--no-workflow` | Skip the Workflow tool; use Agent execution | Named native `deep-reviewer` when the host supports it; role-free Workflow fallback |
| `--metrics` | Observe compatible provider usage when an adapter is configured | unavailable without a compatible adapter |
| `--metrics-db <path>` | Provider telemetry source supplied by an adapter | none |
| `--metrics-ledger <path>` | Content-safe observational metrics path | `<out>/runs/review-metrics.json` |
| `--metrics-reviewer-prefix <path>` | Explicit provider reviewer path for the adapter | none |

## Repo config — `.deep-review.yaml`

Optional repo-root file, the skill-native config standard. Any key absent there falls back to its `.coderabbit.yaml` counterpart (`reviews.*`), so repos migrating from CodeRabbit work unconfigured. Top-level keys, all optional:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `concurrency` | Maximum simultaneous reviewer jobs, an integer from `1` through `6`; defaults to `3` and is pinned in `manifest.json` |
| `path_filters` | Globs over repo-relative paths: `!pat` excludes; bare patterns, when present, restrict review to their matches and beat any exclude; built-in excludes (locks, vendor, generated, testdata, snapshots) always append |
| `graft` | `true` runs the pinned Graft CLI before prompts are materialized; otherwise `graft-context.md` is the single plain-inspection line |
| `request_changes_workflow` | publish-mode review-event gate |

The manifest builder resolves `path_filters` into manifest.json.

## Hard rules

- Source is read-only and **frozen**: the manifest pins `worktree_snapshot`, and run_jobs.py / render_review.py refuse a drifted checkout. Writes go only to `<out>`, `.deep-review/` state, and — with `--publish` — the target PR.
- No file-count cap: a large selection means more cohorts, never a skipped or silently truncated review. Every selected file lands in exactly one cohort.
- Every defect starts with `Premise → Path → Verdict`; every advisory starts with `Premise → Improvement → Fix`.
- Every selected hunk line receives defect-lane coverage.
- Run the repo's linters first; never re-report what a lane already caught.
- Cite rubric rules verbatim with their source path; severity comes from the taxonomy, never inflated.
- Publishing needs `--publish` or the user's explicit go-ahead in this session; otherwise the review stays local.
- Reviewer concurrency is resolved before dispatch: `--concurrency N` overrides `.deep-review.yaml`,
  which overrides the default `3`; valid values are `1` through `6`. The resolved value is frozen in
  `manifest.json`. The legacy no-op `--workers` option is rejected.
- Every review ends with a **SHIP / FIX_BEFORE_SHIP / REWORK** verdict derived by render_review.py and stated only after that script exits 0.
- `FIX_BEFORE_SHIP` is actionable, not a prompt for approval: in an approved loop, follow `docs/guidelines/REVIEW-ROUNDS.md`: fix every defect from its Repair plan, run the scoped gate, then the remediation check below, until no Critical/Major is open or `stall_attempts` halts.
- Optional metrics snapshot provider totals and cumulative checkpoints without changing dispatch,
  retries, outputs, or exits. The main thread records serialized cumulative checkpoints without
  per-job token attribution; totals finalize only after the full scope completes. Hosts without a
  compatible adapter record `unavailable` and continue the review normally. With `graft: true`, the
  pinned Graft CLI runs before prompts are materialized; a failed or absent Graft falls back to
  ordinary repository inspection.
- External `--subagent` runtimes spend `compozy exec` credit.

## Procedure

**Step 1: Funnel — build the manifest**

1. Run the bundled manifest builder (bootstrap helper; reads the repo and `gh`, writes only under `--out`):

   ```bash
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/build_manifest.py --out <out> \
     [--pr N | --base REF | --staged | --worktree] [--files p1,p2] [--full] [--concurrency N]
   ```

   It resolves repo path filters, detects generated / trivial / renamed files, scopes to the incremental delta when prior state exists, and pins the source-freeze snapshot.
2. Read the printed summary. On `--pr`, the script errors with the exact `git fetch` command when the head SHA is absent — run it and retry.

*Done when:* `<out>/manifest.json` exists, every changed file is accounted for as selected, ignored(reason), or skipped(reason), and every selected file carries its hunk list (the units of judgment and the publish anchors).

**Step 2: Knowledge + plan — project rules, cohorts, walkthrough**

1. STOP. Read `<skill-dir>/references/context-pack.md` and `<skill-dir>/references/taxonomy.md` in full before extracting rules or defining reviewer lanes. Run the bootstrap helper (reads the repo, writes only under `<out>`):

   ```bash
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/build_knowledge.py --out <out>
   ```

   Read every source left pending in `<out>/rules.template.json` in full, including direct references of selected project skills. Write `<out>/rules.json` with every source marked applied or not-applicable (reason required), then extract verdict-bearing rules verbatim with scope globs. Assemble `<out>/context-pack.md` and run/fold the detected linter lanes.
2. Read `<skill-dir>/references/orchestration.md` (cohort rules, sweep triggers) and `<skill-dir>/references/output-contracts.md` (walkthrough anatomy, effort scale) in full. Write `<out>/plan.json` — cohorts of up to `<max-cohort-files>` files (default 100) / ~6,000 changed lines plus any sweep whose trigger fires — and `<out>/walkthrough.md`.
3. Run the bootstrap plan gate (reads repo artifacts, writes only under `<out>`):

   ```bash
   python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/build_jobs.py --out <out> \
     [--max-cohort-files N]
   ```

   It rejects incomplete source accounting and over-split plans, proves defect ownership, injects bound rules into every cohort and sweep, and materializes `<out>/jobs.json`.

*Done when:* build_jobs.py exits 0, every discovered source has an audited decision in rules.json, context-pack.md lists applied source/rule and linter outcomes without copying the full registry, and walkthrough.md satisfies its contract.

**Step 3: Review — bounded concurrent jobs**

Execute `<out>/jobs.json` with the mutating runner and engine contract loaded in Step 2. When `--subagent` is not `native`, read `<skill-dir>/references/subagent-runtimes.md` in full before execution. Completion is engine-independent — re-dispatch whatever is listed as pending/invalid until exit 0:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/run_jobs.py --out <out> --validate-only
```

*Done when:* run_jobs.py `--validate-only` exits 0 — every cohort and sweep output matches the schema and completely accounts for assigned hunks. Execute materialized jobs with the bounded concurrency pinned in the manifest, keeping retries inside their worker slot; refill slots after completion, stop refilling after a provider block, and preserve manifest-order status for validation and reporting.

Add optional metrics adapter flags only when compatible telemetry is configured.

**Step 4: Merge + report**

Run the bootstrap merger, mutating state/report renderer, and bootstrap HTML hydrator:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/merge_findings.py --out <out>
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/render_review.py --out <out> [--rework "<structural rationale>"]
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/render_html.py --out <out>
```

merge_findings.py emits `<out>/findings.json` plus `<out>/review-stats.json`, deduplicates both result classes, reconciles rounds, and fails unless every selected hunk line has defect coverage. render_review.py derives the verdict from defects only. render_html.py shows defects, advisories, suppressions, and coverage separately in `<out>/review.html`.

When ReportFindings is available, report defects first and every advisory afterward. The user-facing summary states the verdict, defect/advisory counts, every Critical/Major defect, coverage status, and artifact paths.

*Done when:* render_review.py and render_html.py exit 0 and the final message states the verdict, every Critical and Major defect, and the review.html path.

**Step 5: Publish (only with `--publish`)**

1. Read `<skill-dir>/references/publish-github.md` in full and execute its recipes: upsert the walkthrough, publish every anchorable in-diff defect and advisory inline, keep only unanchorable/outside-diff results in the body, and edit resolved prior-round comments.

*Done when:* the PR shows the updated walkthrough and the new review, and both URLs are cited in the final message.

**Step 6: Learnings**

1. state.json was already written at Step 4. When the user — or a PR reply — rebuts or dismisses a result, read `<skill-dir>/references/state-and-learnings.md` in full, distill the correction into `.deep-review/learnings.md`, and mark that fingerprint `dismissed` in the state ledger.

*Done when:* every user correction from the session is captured as a learning or explicitly declined.

## Remediation check (incremental mode)

The discovery review runs once per group; every later run over the same `<out>` is a remediation check. With prior state (or fingerprints recovered from the PR thread), Step 1 scopes to commits since the last reviewed head and archives the prior round's artifacts under `<out>/rounds/`. Step 2 builds one defect-lane job over the selected paths whose prompt demands a `prior_findings` disposition per `open` prior finding (contract in `references/orchestration.md`). A prior finding resolves only through a `resolved` disposition — absence never resolves it; undispositioned entries stay under Duplicates and count in the verdict. Dismissed fingerprints stay suppressed; resolved ones receive the ✅ edit in publish mode. `--full` reviews the whole diff again. Each run's Step 4 regenerates `<out>/review.html`, so a browser tab left open on it tracks the rounds by itself.

## Error handling

- `--pr` or `--publish` without a passing `gh auth status` → stop and name the gap; publishing by any other transport is out of scope.
- Workflow tool unavailable → automatic Agent fallback; record the mode in walkthrough.md's Review details.
- External `--subagent` failure (model not available, missing/invalid output file, non-zero exit) → apply the failure handling loaded in Step 3.
- Empty selection after the funnel → report "nothing reviewable" with the manifest counts; write no findings.
- A linter lane unavailable → proceed and state in review.md that overlap suppression did not run for that lane.
- A bootstrap gate failing (build_manifest.py, build_knowledge.py, build_jobs.py, merge_findings.py) → stop and surface stderr. Missing knowledge accounting or incomplete defect coverage is a review failure, not a warning.
- run_jobs.py exit 2 (blocked) → a provider block ends the run and writes `<out>/run-blocker.json`; metrics state is observational and never changes this exit path.
- run_jobs.py exit 3 → source drift: restart from Step 1 so the round increments and prior artifacts are archived.
- More than 75 publishable results → use the Step 5 batching contract.

## Bundled implementation

`assets/PROMPT.md`, `assets/findings.schema.json`, and `assets/REVIEW_UI.html` are author-tooling sources consumed by the bundled scripts; agents use their rendered prompt/schema/report artifacts rather than loading these assets directly. `<skill-dir>/scripts/_common.py` is a read-only library imported by the CLIs and is never invoked directly.
