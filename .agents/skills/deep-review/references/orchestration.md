# Orchestration

The pipeline stage map, cohort planning rules, sweep triggers, and the execution engines. Prompt wording is single-sourced in `assets/PROMPT.md` (rendered by `build_jobs.py`); output shape in `assets/findings.schema.json` — this file explains how the stages compose and how jobs get executed.

## Pipeline — stages, gates, artifacts

Every stage materializes jobs with lane ownership (`{label, kind, lane, prompt, output, required_hunks, rule_ids}`), executes them on any engine, and passes a script gate. Valid outputs are preserved, so re-running touches only missing or invalid work.

| Stage | Produce | Execute | Gate (exit 0) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Knowledge | `build_knowledge.py` → knowledge.json + rules.template.json | — | source discovery |
| Plan | `build_jobs.py` → prompts + jobs.json | — | source accounting + ownership |
| Review | — | jobs.json (defect cohorts + sweeps) | `run_jobs.py --validate-only` |
| Merge | `merge_findings.py` → findings.json + review-stats.json | — | complete defect-lane coverage |
| Report | `render_review.py` → review.md + state.json; `render_html.py` → review.html | — | `render_review.py` |

Both job kinds (`cohort`, `sweep`) return the same schema: defects, advisories, hunk coverage, and optional suppressions and rule notes. `hunk` is the assigned canonical range (`<side>:<start>-<end>`), null outside the diff. Defects use the causal certificate; advisories use the improvement certificate.

## Cohort rules (Step 2)

1. Group selected files by package/directory and domain: a source file, its tests, and its types travel together; a file pulled apart from its test loses its reviewer the cheapest evidence.
2. Size: target ~400 changed lines per cohort, so at most `min(concurrency, ceil(changed_lines / 400))` cohorts (fewer is allowed), each ≤ `--max-cohort-files` files (default `100`) **and** ≤ ~6,000 changed lines. Pass the same value to `build_jobs.py`; a single oversized file becomes its own cohort.
3. **Oversized-file split** — when one file alone exceeds ~6,000 changed lines, divide the search across sibling reviewers: same file, disjoint slices of its manifest hunks (`hunk_scope`), one cohort per slice. Every slice reviewer reads the whole file for context but judges only its slice; build_jobs.py proves the merged slices cover every hunk line exactly once.
4. Tag each cohort `risk: high|normal|low` — high when it touches storage/migrations, security/auth, public contracts, or concurrency; low for docs/config-only. Risk feeds reviewer emphasis, not selection.
5. Every selected file in exactly one cohort (or, when sliced, every hunk line in exactly one slice) — build_jobs.py rejects any other shape. `plan.json`:

```json
{ "cohorts": [
    { "id": "c01", "name": "store: task queue", "risk": "high",
      "files": ["internal/store/queue.go", "internal/store/queue_test.go"] },
    { "id": "c02a", "name": "loop/action.go — hunks 1-14", "risk": "high",
      "files": ["internal/loop/action.go"],
      "hunk_scope": { "internal/loop/action.go": [{"start": 12, "lines": 40, "side": "new"}] } }
  ],
  "sweeps": ["contracts", {"key": "layering", "lens": "custom lens text"}] }
```

Sweeps are bare keys from the table below (built-in lens text) or `{key, lens}` objects for a custom lens.

When `manifest.mode` is `incremental` (a remediation check), `build_jobs.py` ignores `cohorts` and `sweeps` (printing `sweeps skipped in incremental mode` when any were planned) and emits one defect-lane job `cohort-rc` over every selected path, carrying `prior_fingerprints` for every `open` ledger entry in `state.json`; the prompt's PRIOR FINDINGS block demands one `prior_findings` disposition row per fingerprint. Write `plan.json` as usual; its cohorts are not consulted.

`build_jobs.py` rejects a plan with more cohorts than the rule-2 target and prints `cohort target: E for L changed lines at concurrency C`: merge the cohorts.

## Sweep triggers

Sweeps are **opt-in and rare** — default to none. Each sweep is one extra agent that sees the manifest, not one cohort; include it only when its trigger clearly fires and the plan has three or more cohorts (`build_jobs.py` rejects sweeps on smaller plans), and prefer at most one or two per round:

| Key | Trigger | Looks for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contracts` | exported/wire/API symbol changed contract | breaking changes, drift between spec/impl/clients, missing codegen co-ship |
| `security` | new endpoint/input path/authz surface/secret handling | injection, missing authn/authz, secret leakage, cross-tenant access |
| `migrations` | schema/migration files in diff | destructive ops, missing migration for model change, ordering/identity hazards |
| `consistency` | renames or repeated patterns in diff | incomplete renames, sibling paths not mirroring a fix, duplicated logic |
| `config` | config keys/flags/env vars changed | unwired or undocumented keys, dead flags, default mismatches |

## Engines

The jobs contract makes engines interchangeable — pick one per run, record it in walkthrough.md's Review details (`Mode: workflow | agent-fallback | subagent:<runtime>`), and always close the loop with `run_jobs.py --validate-only`. Validation rejects missing coverage rows, in-diff anchors outside job ownership, and unassigned rule ids.

**Named native dispatch (default when host supports it).** Dispatch up to the manifest concurrency
bound to the custom `deep-reviewer` agent, refill slots as jobs complete, and keep retries inside
the owning worker slot. After a provider block, let active attempts finish and do not refill. Use
the host's real selector:

- Claude Code Task: `subagent_type: "deep-reviewer"`.
- Cursor `cursor/task`: `subagentType: { custom: "deep-reviewer" }`.
- Native Agent/spawn: custom agent name/type `deep-reviewer`, resolved from the host's local agent
  configuration.

Metrics are optional provider-neutral hooks. An adapter may call `start_metrics`,
`checkpoint_metrics`, and `finalize_metrics` around the bounded dispatch; the main thread records
serialized cumulative snapshots only and never assigns overlapping deltas to jobs or changes exits.
Record `Mode: native` in walkthrough.md, then run the validate-only gate. Provider-specific
telemetry setup belongs in the runtime adapter guidance, not in this orchestration contract.

Before prompts are materialized, `build_jobs.py` runs the pinned Graft CLI only when
`.deep-review.yaml` sets `graft: true`: `graft build`, repository-map lookup, blast-radius tracing,
and symbol lookup are written to the prompt's context artifact; without the flag that artifact is
the single plain-inspection line and no subprocess runs. Graft is an optional inspection aid: a missing binary, stale map, or failed
command falls back to plain repository inspection and does not block review. Graft does not index
dot-directories, so selected `.agents` paths always carry an explicit plain-inspection fallback.

**Workflow fallback (when named native dispatch is unavailable).** One generic script executes any
stage's pending jobs — pass the pending list from the validate-only status file as `args.jobs` and
launch at most the manifest concurrency. Refill completed slots, stop refilling after a provider
block, and preserve jobs-file order when the stage returns. This path intentionally stays role-free;
it does not assume a named-agent parameter.

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'deep-review-jobs',
  description: 'Execute pending deep-review jobs; each agent reads a prompt file and writes one output file',
  phases: [{ title: 'Execute' }],
}
// args: { jobs: [{label, prompt, output}], concurrency?: integer } — PENDING jobs only
phase('Execute')
let returned = 0
const inputJobs = [...(args.jobs ?? [])]
const pending = [...inputJobs]
const requestedConcurrency = args?.concurrency
if (requestedConcurrency !== undefined &&
    (!Number.isInteger(requestedConcurrency) || requestedConcurrency < 1 || requestedConcurrency > 6)) {
  throw new Error('concurrency must be an integer from 1 through 6')
}
const resolvedConcurrency = requestedConcurrency === undefined ? 3 : requestedConcurrency
const workerLimit = Math.min(resolvedConcurrency, pending.length)
const active = []
const resultsByLabel = new Map()
let providerBlock = null
while (pending.length || active.length) {
  while (!providerBlock && pending.length && active.length < workerLimit) {
    const j = pending.shift()
    const promise = agent(`Read ${j.prompt} and follow it exactly. It defines the review task, the JSON ` +
      `schema, and the single file you write (${j.output}). Repo files are read-only. ` +
      `Reply with one sentence once the artifact is written.`,
      { label: j.label, phase: 'Execute' }).then(
        () => ({ label: j.label, status: 'pass' }),
        (error) => {
          const message = String(error?.message ?? error)
          return { label: j.label, status: message.includes('usageLimitExceeded') ? 'blocked' : 'fail', error: message }
        },
      )
    active.push({ label: j.label, promise })
  }
  if (!active.length) break
  const finished = await Promise.race(active.map(({ promise }) => promise))
  const index = active.findIndex(({ label }) => label === finished.label)
  active.splice(index, 1)
  resultsByLabel.set(finished.label, finished)
  if (finished.status === 'blocked' && providerBlock === null) providerBlock = finished
  if (finished.status === 'pass') returned += 1
}
const orderedJobs = inputJobs.map(({ label }) => resultsByLabel.get(label) ?? ({ label, status: 'pending' }))
const unfinished = orderedJobs.filter(({ status }) => status !== 'pass')
return {
  dispatched: inputJobs.length,
  returned,
  jobs: orderedJobs,
  blocker: providerBlock,
  pending: unfinished,
}
```

After the workflow returns, run the validate-only gate; re-invoke with the still-pending jobs (interrupted runs can also resume via `resumeFromRunId`). Two re-dispatches without progress → inspect a failing output by hand before continuing.

**Agent fallback (`--no-workflow` or no Workflow tool).** Same contract through the Agent tool: use
the named native selectors above when available. If the host has no named-agent path, use the
generic prompt-only subagent dispatch ("Read `<prompt>` and follow it exactly…") with the manifest
concurrency bound; do not add an unsupported role argument. Then run the validate-only gate.

**External runtimes (`--subagent` ≠ `native`).** `run_jobs.py --command` drives `compozy exec` per
subagent-runtimes.md — the runner owns bounded execution, retries, output validation,
provider-block detection, and the freeze check.

The orchestrator never reviews inline, regardless of PR size: reviewers spend their own context on their cohort; the orchestrator plans, dispatches, gates, and reports.

### Bounded dispatch

The manifest builder resolves reviewer concurrency once, with precedence `--concurrency N` over
`.deep-review.yaml` over the default `3`, validates `1` through `6`, and pins the result in
`manifest.json`. Every execution engine consumes that pinned value. It launches up to
`min(concurrency, pending jobs)`, refills a worker slot after completion, and never schedules a
new job after the first provider block. Active attempts finish; pending and blocked jobs remain in
the blocker ledger. Results are stored by label and emitted in jobs-file order, regardless of
completion order. The removed legacy `--workers` option is rejected.
