# QA Plan

Plan a reviewable QA cycle for a user-visible change. Keep the plan stack-agnostic: the consuming
project's operational profile chooses the public interface and adapter later.

## Provenance

Author: Antonio Fulgêncio.

This is an original project-owned adaptation for this workflow, inspired by Pedro Nauck's
[`qa-report` skill](https://github.com/pedronauck/skills/tree/main/skills/mine/qa-report).

## Inputs and boundaries

Read the feature contract or Verifier packet, the current diff, `docs/qa/README.md`, and the
affected QA records. Read `docs/guidelines/QA-SCENARIOS.md` in full before creating or changing a
scenario. It owns the scenario tree, fields, ids, statuses, and flag/reset rules.

Plan journeys, scenarios, and charters. Leave live walks, evidence capture, defect remediation,
and framework selection to `qa-execute` or the next independent Verifier session.

When the profile is missing or incomplete, read
[`references/profile.md`](references/profile.md) in full before discovering capabilities or writing
`docs/qa/README.md`.

## Procedure

### 1. Resolve scope

Read the feature contract, acceptance criteria, current diff, and existing QA records. Classify each
changed surface as user-visible or internal. Include routes, screens, public configuration, CLI
commands, API responses, mobile surfaces, and user-facing copy when their observable behaviour
changed.

Maintain a criterion disposition for every changed acceptance criterion. Map user-visible criteria
to a QA journey/scenario; for an internal criterion, enumerate it in the handoff with the reason it
does not change a user-visible promise. If no criterion is user-visible, record `no user-visible
change` in the task handoff and stop.

For a visual criterion, point the disposition at the owning feature `uiux.md` reference row and follow
`UI-UX.md#verifying-the-built-screen`. The visual comparison remains evidence for that criterion; it
does not replace behavioral coverage.

**Done when:** every changed acceptance criterion has one explicit disposition, and the no-surface
case has a written handoff.

### 2. Load the QA context

Read `docs/qa/README.md`, the relevant personas, journeys, scenarios, open bugs, and current
charters. If the operational profile is absent or lacks a capability needed to plan the scope,
follow [`references/profile.md`](references/profile.md) in full and record discovered facts with
links to executable manifests or CI. Keep product-owned documentation intact while updating the
profile.

**Done when:** the plan names the profile path, every in-scope persona, and every existing journey or
scenario that can cover the changed surface.

### 3. Map the promises

Map every user-visible acceptance criterion to an existing journey under `docs/qa/journeys/` and a
scenario under `docs/qa/scenarios/`. Mint a stable, content-addressed scenario for a new promise.
Fold duplicate coverage into the canonical scenario and record overlaps there. Include one adjacent
canary journey when the feature has a user-visible surface. Keep each internal criterion's explicit
reason in the disposition handoff.

Use the schema and status vocabulary from `QA-SCENARIOS.md`; keep field definitions in that file.
Describe the expected observable in user language and preserve scenario ids once published.

**Done when:** every changed acceptance criterion has a disposition: one canonical
`docs/qa/journeys/` + `docs/qa/scenarios/` mapping for a user-visible promise, or a handoff entry
that names the criterion and explains why no user promise changed.

### 4. Flag the cycle

Create a scenario under `docs/qa/scenarios/` with `qa_status: untested` when the promise is new.
Reset an affected existing scenario to `untested` when the diff changes its promise. Link open bugs
and preserve the latest report path and evidence according to the schema. Update journey maps under
`docs/qa/journeys/` when the route through the product changed.

**Done when:** every affected scenario is new or reset to `untested`, and its journey, bug links,
and report references are internally consistent.

### 5. Write session charters

Create one new dated charter under `docs/qa/charters/` per meaningful persona × journey × tour ×
time-box for this cycle. Never update an existing charter. Journeys and scenarios may be refreshed
when the contract changes. Point each charter at its scenario and journey, state the public entry
point, and define the observable that proves success. Include the adjacent canary and prioritize
changed or risky paths.

**Done when:** every affected scenario is covered by a dated, bounded charter with a persona,
journey, entry point, tour, time-box, and expected observable.

### 6. Hand off for execution

Summarize the criterion disposition ledger, the `docs/qa/journeys/`, `docs/qa/scenarios/`, and
`docs/qa/charters/` outputs, profile path, adapter candidates, and any missing prerequisite for the
next fresh Verifier. State that execution must use `qa-execute`, the project's existing public
interface, and the profile's declared adapter. End this skill before launching the product or
changing product code.

**Done when:** the handoff lists every changed criterion with its disposition, every affected
scenario and charter output, names the next Verifier session, and contains no live execution result
or product fix.
